## Introduction
The following project aims to improvise Fast Fourier Transfor algorithm to calculate the fundamental frequency of the given audio input. 

## Background
To visualise the world of harmony.
The digital Signal which has been recorded via any input device does not provide much infomration about different frequencies which are present.
Hence, we need to analyze the data.
The following project has been inspired by [Spectrum Analyzer by Academo](https://academo.org/demos/spectrum-analyzer/).
Analyzed data can be visualised using spectorgram. The frequency spectrum is generated by applying a Fourier Transform to the time-domain signal.
